# PrimeTrader

Greetings, I am a old Binance user, I already had a KYC verified account, yet for the past days i was not able to use the API and secret, because Binance testnet is not letting me login and kept on saying I am unverified even though I am already verified. 

I will attach screenshots for proof.

I made a mock version of the project where the API key and secret is not needed but the client can enter their API key and secret in GUI if Binance permits them to login.

I was trying to make an auto trading bot which will web scrape the Indicators on trading sites and take decisions accordingly. But i was not able to web scrape the data.

the GUI triggers CLI commands in the backend which we can see in the activity log and the terminal which is given, after running the .exe after extracting bot.zip.

the .exe version of this code is attached in the mail as well as given in the internsala site

Thank you for reading.
Yours faithful
Devansh
